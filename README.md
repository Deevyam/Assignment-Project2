# Real-Time Weather Monitoring and Alert System

## Overview

This project implements a real-time weather monitoring system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches live weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API, processes it to generate daily summaries, and sends alerts when specific weather thresholds are breached. Users can visualize daily weather summaries and trends directly on a simple web interface.

## Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Continuously retrieves weather data from OpenWeatherMap at configurable intervals.
- **Daily Aggregates**: Summarizes daily temperature statistics and weather conditions.
- **Custom Alerts**: Allows setting of thresholds for specific weather conditions and triggers notifications when thresholds are exceeded.
- **Visualization**: Displays daily summaries and alert history on a clean HTML/CSS-based dashboard.

## Data Source

The system retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. You will need to sign up for a free API key to access weather information for cities in India, including:

- Delhi
- Mumbai
- Chennai
- Bangalore
- Kolkata
- Hyderabad

### Key Data Points:

- **Temperature** (in Celsius or Fahrenheit based on user preference)
- **Feels-like Temperature**
- **Weather Condition** (Clear, Rain, Snow, etc.)
- **Timestamp** of data update

## Project Breakdown

### 1. Fetching Weather Data

- JavaScript `fetch()` is used to make API calls to OpenWeatherMap.
- The API call is made at configurable intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes).
- The system supports temperature conversion between Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit.

### 2. Daily Aggregations

Average Temperature: Calculates the mean temperature for each day.
Maximum and Minimum Temperatures: Identifies the highest and lowest recorded temperatures for the day.
Dominant Weather Condition: Determines the most frequently occurring weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy).
Workflow:
Data Fetching: The service retrieves weather data for a specified city or location from an external API.
Aggregation: It processes the raw data to calculate daily summaries for each metric.
Storage: The aggregated summaries are stored in a MongoDB collection for easy retrieval and further analysis.
Usage:
Manual Trigger: The aggregation can be triggered manually via an API endpoint (e.g., /api/weather/aggregate).
Scheduled Automation: It can be set up to run automatically at regular intervals (e.g., daily) using a cron job.

### 3. Alerts

- Users can configure custom thresholds (e.g., temperature exceeding 35Â°C).
- When the threshold is breached, the system triggers an alert notification.
- Alerts can be displayed on the screen or sent via email (using external libraries like nodemailer).

### 4. Data Visualization

- Simple HTML and CSS are used to build a web interface that shows:
  - Daily weather summaries.
  - Alerts triggered by breached thresholds.
  - Historical trends using temperature data.
